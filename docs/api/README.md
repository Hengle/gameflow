# API

The main objectives of the GameFlow API \(Application Programming Interface\) are extensibility and communication with other scripts. In concrete, the possibilites offered by the current version are the following:

* Creating your own [custom actions](custom-actions.md) and [custom conditions](custom-conditions.md).
* Building block sequences programmatically, like [templates](templates.md).
* [Communication with GameFlow](communication.md): searching for blocks in order to access their public properties and methods.
* [Direct execution](direct-execution.md) of actions from your scripts.
* [Listening](event-listening.md) and reaction to GameFlow events from your scripts.

The usage of the API does not requiere expert knowledge of C\#, but having at least some notions is recommended for an easier understanding of the companion examples.
